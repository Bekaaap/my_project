                            Mary Kay Ash cosmetics turned the ordinary housewife into a business mogul by employing them as distributors, salespeople, and marketers, all at once. Network marketing, a strategy still used today by companies like Avon and Essential Oils, had been around long before Mary Kay Ash cosmetics came onto the scene. However, other companies failed to realize the potential of bored housewives who wanted something more flexible than a 9-5 job and thus, Mary Kay takes the credit for the transformation of network marketing. Additionally, the genius behind awarding her top sellers pink Cadillacs and essentially creating mobile advertisements should also be recognized here.

                        <p class="research_txt">Bell is credited for creating the first ad jingle, debuting on Christmas Eve of 1926. The jingle, “Have You Tried Wheaties?”, caused product sales to spike in areas where it was played. Seeing the potential behind the jingle, Bell decided to turn it into a national program and Wheaties became one of the most popular cereals in the world.PHILIP KOTLER is S. C.
